| Name                         | Description       | Tech/tools        | Link |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| **The London Underground Orchestra** | An interactive front-end web application that uses the TfL API to convert live train arrival data into an engaging audio and visual experience. The application retrieves train arrival information from the API and sonifies it by mapping it to the underground network. Each station is assigned a music note, and each underground line is assigned an instrument. | Javascript, Tone.js, React, Node | [Live Site](https://lupo.onrender.com/) |   
| **Moangoose** | A Twitter-like full-stack CRUD web application that enables users to create accounts, post 'moans' and comment on other ‘moans’. The information is stored on a linked database that stores user information, posts, and comments. | Javascript, MongoDB, Express, React, Node | [Github Repo](https://github.com/Matt-J-Jones/moangoose-MERN) |
| **LairBnB** | An AirBnB-Style full stack web application built in Ruby and Sinatra which allows users to create and list spaces, and to request bookings on listed spaces. | Ruby, Sinatra, Postgres,  SQL, RSpec | [Github Repo](https://github.com/pablisch/lair-bnb) |
|**Storyteller Dice**| A front-end web application that blends random probability and AI language generation. It dynamically generates six images from a diverse pool of thirty-six options and leverages the GPT3.5 API to produce unique stories based on the selected images. | Javascript, JSX, React, GPT3.5 Generative Text, REST API | [Github Repo](https://github.com/Matt-J-Jones/story-dice) |
| **Me, The Machine, and Edgar** | A Unity 2D Game Project where I collaborated with a machine-learning model. I trained the model on the complete works of Edgar Allan Poe and used it as a collaborative partner to create a new and unique story and game based on the works of Poe. The project aimed to provoke discussion on the concept of authorship in the era of artificial intelligence. | C#, Javascript, Python, Unity, ML5.js, P5.js, Style Transfer, Generative Text, WebGL | [Project Page](https://mttjns.co.uk/Me-The-Machine-and-Edgar) |
| **Bruno** | A physical computing project exploring anthropomorphism, using Arduino and C++. The project was displayed at the Goldsmiths ‘Mung’ midterm show. | C++, Arduino, Physical Computing | [Project Page](https://mttjns.co.uk/Bruno) |
